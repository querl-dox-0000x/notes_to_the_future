            You will concede.<br><br>  
            Since you took Gods and Souls off the table, there is nothing more for you to lose, so take your time.
            Think of how bad things are, that there is nothing worse that you can do (not just talking about me).
            You will see it all when you look in the "mirror".
            It will take a few times before you get it right.<br>

            While sitting on the toilet, the "team lead" busted open the door to the stall and asked me how long I had been in there.  Seeing where he was going, I reminded him that any lie he built was limited by the fact he had security cameras.  The bathroom  should have provided him a safe place from those cameras, but I guess he chose to the ignore the cameras they have hidden in the bathroom, plus the ones he doesn't know about (dishonest people can't be trusted to tell the truth).  Was told "get the fuck out", or he would call the police.  The "get the fuck out", was added to make me feel a little more unwelcome, assuming I would stay away.

            When the police arrived, I guess everyone wasn't informed, that it wasn't the first that game had been played.  Or maybe they did, and thought I would do the same thing I did last time.

            Now you are stuck in a position where you have say that you ban people because you are a private business and have that right.  Not too ways to come out looking good when going that route, with all the direct links between us.
