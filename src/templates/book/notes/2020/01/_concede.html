            You will concede.<br><br>  
            Since you took Gods and Souls off the table, there is nothing more for you to lose, so take your time.
            Think of how bad things are, that there is nothing worse that you can do (not just talking about me).
            You will see it all when you look in the "mirror".
            It will take a few times before you get it right.<br>

            While sitting on the toilet, the "team lead" busted open the door to the stall and asked me how long I had been in there.  Seeing where he was going, I reminded him that any lie he built was limited by the fact he had security cameras.  The bathroom  should have provided him a safe place from those cameras, but I guess he chose to the ignore the cameras they have hidden in the bathroom, plus the ones he doesn't know about (dishonest people can't be trusted to tell the truth).  Was told "get the fuck out", or he would call the police.  The "get the fuck out", was added to make me feel a little more unwelcome, assuming I would stay away.

            Told him to call the police.

            When the police arrived, I guess everyone wasn't informed, that it wasn't the first that game had been played.  Or maybe they did, and thought I would do the same thing I did last time.

            Now you are stuck in a position where you have to say that you ban/deny services to people because you are a private business and have that right.  Not too many ways to come out looking good when going that route, especially with all the direct links between us.

            After bringing in the police under false pretenses, 3 arrests, and jail time, its safe to say you forfeit future claims of a misunderstanding.  When you are seeking those public funds in the future, remember, "you are a private company and can deny service to whoever you want".  Those stuck in the hole with you, will toss you a few bones every once in a while, but they will fade away eventually.  New friends will be hard to find, and the few you do find, you will regret.

            Speaking of your hole, in this "Known World", all our links are eternal.  Our history goes back to 2017.  You can understand there are some things a person doesnt forget.  You took solace that you weren't the only one, ignoring that meant you don't have exclusive ownership of the data, with some saling it.  Helps when you know what you are looking at.  Look in the "mirror" again for me (maybe hand the keyboard over to someone who knows what they are doing).  Quite an ugly picture.
